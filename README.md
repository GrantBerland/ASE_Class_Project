# Advanced State Estimation Class Project

* test_EKF.m is an entry point script that generates synthetic data on a satellite orbit that is the same as the ISS, and filters the results
* plot_B_field_and_orbit.m generates three nice plots showing the synthetic B-field data, the groundtrack of the orbit, and the orbit in space around Earth with IGRF fieldlines drawn
